# Contribution guidelines for the Clinical Data Sources repository

## Project Philosophy

this repository of open and easy to access clinical data sources is an open source community-based project. We want to make it easy for interested researchers to access clinical datasets as easily as possible.

## Issues

We use GitHub Issues for a wide range of tasks including bug reports, feature requests, planning, and general forum. If you have any comments or quesstions feel free to create a github issue.

## Pull Requests

We operate on a pull request model, all changes/additions should be submitted via [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/ "GitHub Â· Using pull requests"). 

To keep the commit history clean, we may ask you to [rebase your pull request](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/How-to-Rebase-a-Pull-Request "How to Rebase a Pull Request") or squash certain commits. If you don't know what this means, we'll help you through the process.

## Peer Review

All pull requests undergo peer review in which project participants review the changes. Reviewers may suggest modifications or even note their disapproval. Reviewers can note their approval by commenting along the lines of ":+1:", "looks good to me", or "approved". As a reviewer, it's helpful to note the type of review you performed: have you used the data, only accessed it, looked it over, or are you just supporting the concept?

Before a repository maintainer merges a pull request, there must be at least one affirmative review. If there is any unaddressed criticism or disapproval, a repository maintainer will determine how to proceed and may wait for additional feedback.

**Happy contributing!**
